# ASCII Banner Font Showcase

A high-performance, static web application to showcase and compare FIGlet ASCII art fonts.

## Features
- **Modern Stack:** Vite + TypeScript.
- **Self-Contained:** All assets (fonts and the FIGlet engine) are committed to the repository for maximum portability and robustness.
- **Automated Maintenance:** A GitHub Action regularly checks for upstream updates to `patorjk/figlet.js` and opens Pull Requests for new versions.
- **Alphabetical Rendering:** Fonts are sorted alphabetically and rendered asynchronously with consistent ordering.

## Architecture: Full Repo-Based Asset Model
This project uses a "Full Repo-Based" (Model 1) strategy. Assets are extracted from NPM but committed to Git.

### Asset Lifecycle Commands
The following `npm` scripts manage the asset lifecycle:
- `npm run check-latest-version-patorjk`: Checks for the latest version of the `figlet` package on NPM.
- `npm run fetch-assets-patorjk`: Updates the `figlet` dependency in `package.json`.
- `npm run extract-assets-patorjk`: Extracts the library engine and fonts from `node_modules` into the project and updates the central manifest.
- `npm run clean-assets-patorjk`: Removes patorjk-specific assets from the project.
- `npm run clean-assets`: Removes all assets from the project.

### Metadata
Metadata for all assets is consolidated in `src/assets/manifest.json`. This manifest includes:
- Source name and version.
- Last updated timestamp (ISO 8601).
- Complete list of available fonts.

## Development
```bash
# Install development dependencies
npm install

# Extract assets (if not already present)
npm run extract-assets-patorjk

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Deployment
The app is a zero-build static site. The `dist/` folder generated by `npm run build` can be served by any static host.
