# Font Origins & Licensing

## The Patorjk Collection
The fonts currently used in this project are primarily sourced from the [patorjk/figlet.js](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js) repository. This collection is one of the most comprehensive and well-maintained sets of FIGlet fonts available in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Licensing
- **Library License:** The `figlet.js` library itself is licensed under the **MIT License**.
- **Font Licensing:** Patrick Gillespie (patorjk), the maintainer, has stated that there are "no licensing issues" with the fonts in his collection. 
- **General Consensus:** FIGlet fonts (FLF files) are generally considered public domain or released under very permissive licenses (like the 3-clause BSD of the original FIGlet C program). In the US, the visual representation of font glyphs (especially bitmap-like ASCII art) is often not copyrightable as software code, further reducing legal friction for redistribution.

## Provenance
- **History:** Most FIGlet fonts were created between 1991 and 2000 by a global community of hobbyists. They were originally distributed via FTP servers and USENET.
- **Aggregation:** Collectors like Patorjk, Xero, and hIMEI have aggregated these historical fonts into modern Git repositories to prevent them from becoming "lost media".
- **Attribution:** While individual fonts often contain author names in their internal comment sections, many are credited to handles or emails that are no longer active.

## Summary for ASCII Banners
We can continue to use and redistribute these fonts under the assumption that they are permissively licensed or in the public domain, which is the standard practice for the FIGlet ecosystem. For absolute clarity, we can look for specific licenses within individual `.flf` files if we ever encounter a "commercial use" restriction (rare in this community).
