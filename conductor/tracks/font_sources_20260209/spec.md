# Track Specification: Evaluate & Integrate Additional Font Sources

## Overview
Based on research, `xero/figlet-fonts` contains ~87 unique fonts not found in our base `patorjk` collection. This track focuses on the careful integration of these fonts.

## Goals
1. **Integration:** Download and add the unique fonts from `xero/figlet-fonts` to our `public/fonts` directory.
2. **De-duplication:** Ensure no duplicate fonts are added (handling filename case differences and minor content variations).
3. **Consistency:** Verify that new fonts render correctly in the current application.

## Future Note
`hIMEI29A/FigletFonts` has been evaluated and will be skipped for now due to low traffic and esoteric content.
