# Track Specification: Implement Asset Synchronization & UI Version Display

## Overview
This track implements the finalized Local Maintenance strategy, including automated monthly updates and UI transparency.

## Goals
1. **GitHub Action:** Create a workflow to sync with `patorjk/figlet.js` releases on the 1st of every month.
2. **Sync Logic:** Update the `Makefile` and scripts to handle release-based downloads and version tracking.
3. **UI Transparency:** Display the currently used FIGlet version in the application UI (e.g., FAQ or Footer).
