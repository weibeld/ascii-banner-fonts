# Track Specification: Implement Asset Synchronization & UI Version Display

## Overview
This track implements the finalized Local Maintenance strategy using NPM and Vite, including automated monthly updates and UI transparency.

## Goals
1. **Automated Sync:** Create a GitHub Action to update the `figlet` package and refresh local assets on the 1st of every month.
2. **Build Integration:** Implement a robust copy script to transfer fonts from `node_modules` to `public/` and generate a manifest.
3. **UI Transparency:** Display the currently used FIGlet version in the application UI.
