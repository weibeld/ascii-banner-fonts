# Track Specification: Project Refinement & Roadmap Planning

## Overview
Perform a systematic extraction and grooming of the project brain-dump. Transition from a monolithic document to a structured series of research papers, implementation tracks, and architectural decisions.

## Goals
1. **Context Preservation:** Extract all items from `brain-dump-2026-02-20.md` into atomic helper files within the track.
2. **Architectural Evaluation:** Specifically evaluate the "Central Font Repository" strategy and its impact on the current codebase.
3. **Roadmap Definition:** Convert groomed items into actionable tracks or permanent documentation.
4. **Knowledge Consolidation:** Ensure no research or ecosystem knowledge is lost during the transition.

## Strategy
- **Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction.** Verbatim 1:1 mapping of brain-dump sections to files in `items/`.
- **Phase 2: Strategic Alignment.** Evaluation of high-level architectural pivots (e.g., Font Data Repo).
- **Phase 3: Item-by-Item Grooming.** Sequential discussion and migration of each extracted item.
- **Completion:** The track is complete when all helper files are processed and deleted.

## Impact
- **Decoupling:** Enables the potential separation of font data logic from UI logic.
- **Organisation:** Provides a clean, manageable backlog.
- **Clarity:** Formalises research into the permanent project record.
