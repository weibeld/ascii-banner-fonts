- Evaluate additional FIGlet font sources on https://www.figlet.org/ (list of links below "Many fonts are also available:")
  - ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/fonts/: (URL from https://www.figlet.org/faq.html and https://www.figlet.org/) unsecured access actually works with FileZilla or macOS Finder, fonts are available, find a way to programmatically download and analyse collections, especially overlap with patorjk font collection. Incorporate task into [font_sources_20260209] track
  - TBD: these collections also include international fonts (ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/fonts/international.tar.gz) which map ASCII characters to characters of international alphabets. Should we also include these fonts and add an additional category?
    - Actually the international fonts in this package are included in the patorjk collection (except the CJK font pacakge below)
    - For the international fonts, consider a feature where you can input the desired text in the target alphabet and the conversion to the corresponding ASCII characters (to be compatible with the FIGlet font format) happens automatically (requires the feature to know the mappings, which probably need to be extracted manually from the comment sections of the international font files).
      - Could this be done through the same input field? I.e. input in any character set, and then only the fonts that can print the entered characters are displayed. E.g. you can enter カタカナ and then only the Japanese fonts that can print this are displayed, without the need to select any special settings in the UI
      - In that case, what to do if a user enters the ASCII characters that are mapped to the international characters (we can assume that in this case the user actually wants o print the ASCII characters since support for international characters is implemented by entering the international characters directly)? In that case, since these specific ASCII characters cannot be printed by the font (since they're mapped to international characters) simply omit printing them.
    - Mind-blowing: the international font collection also includes a CJK package for FIGlet 2.2 which includes fonts for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean that contain thousands of kanji. Check if this can be used in any way (i.e. what input characters are mapped to the kanji?)
