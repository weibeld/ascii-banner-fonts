- Revisit categorisation by other tools https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/ and https://patorjk.com/software/taag/:
  - We have written in a research doc or elsewhere that the categorisations used by these tools is not meaningful, however, this should be updated based on the analysis elsewhere in this todo list
    - The categorisation on Manytools largely follows the categorisation on TAAG (including distinction of "Selected FIGlet Fonts" and "Other FIGlet Fonts", which is not relevant to us), however some details vary, for example, there is no "TOIlet Fonts" category and there are fewer fonts in the "ASCII-extended fonts"/"ANSI FIGlet Fonts" section. Manytools is probably based on an older version of https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js, (btw, it explicitly states that it is based on https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js)
