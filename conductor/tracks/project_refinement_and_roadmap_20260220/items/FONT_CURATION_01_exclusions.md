- Font candidates for exclusion (fonts that are part of a collection we use but that we may omit in our own registry):
  - Mnemonic (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Mnemonic.flf): this is not really a display font, but a mapping of special non-ASCII characters to an obsolete standard of mnemonics encoded as a FIGlet font. For example, inputting "Æ" simply prints "&AE". These mnemonics were defined in [RFC 1345](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1345) in 1992. This font is part of the patorjk collection, but it seems not be part of the ftp.figlet.org set
  - ICL-1900 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/ICL-1900.flf): this font prints characters in the ICL-1900 punch card format, which is also not really useful (looks like something is broken). Also not part of the ftp.figlet.org collection.
  - Octal (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Octal.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their octal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Hex (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Hex.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their hexadecimal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Binary (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Binary.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their binary ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Decimal (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Decimal.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their decimal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Morse (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Morse.flf): mapping of ASCII characters to Morse code, not a display font, not in ftp.figlet.org collection
  - Morse2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Morse2.flf): idem Morse
  - Nancyj-Improved (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Nancyj-Improved.flf): seems to be identical to Nancyj (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Nancyj.flf) with the only difference that Nancyj-Improved uses Windows line endings while Nancyj uses Unix line endings. The ftp.figlet.org collection only contains Nancyj but not Nancyj-Improved
  - Rot13 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Rot13.flf): not a display font, simply rotates alphabetical characters by 13 positions, also included in the ftp.figlet.org collection
  - Upside Down Text (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Upside%20Down%20Text.flf): a mapping of characters to upside down lookalike characters, not really a banner display font, created by patorjk
  - WideTerm (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/WideTerm.flf): this is mapping of characters to their CJK full-width equivalents, i.e. the latin full-width characters in the CJK input methods, not really a display font, from the TOIlet fonts
  - WoW (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Wow.flf): single row leetspeak font that is very unreadable, coming from the World of Warcraft world from 2005, pretty outdated
  - 1Row (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/1Row.flf): single row leetspeak font very unreadable, very similar to WoW
  - B1FF (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/B1FF.flf): another leetspeak font
  - Benjamin (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Benjamin.flf): another leetspeak font
  - AMC 3 LIV (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/AMC%203%20Liv1.flf): 3-line high, 90 degrees rotated, very unreadable font (reminds of leetspeak)
  - Circle (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Circle.flf): mapping of characters to circled characters (like e.g. Ⓐ), not a display font, TOIlet font, part of the official TOIlet font distribution
  - Crawford (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Crawford.flf): this font has been improved by patorjk as Crawford2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Crawford2.flf) which is much better. Exclude Crawford and instead rename Crawford2 to "Crawford Patorjk"
  - DWhistled (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/DWhistled.flf): not a display font, according to its own comment a mapping for prodcuing "fingering charts, called tablature, for six hole diatonic flutes such as the tin whistle"
  - Efti Chess (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Chess.flf): mapping to something else than textual characters
  - Efti Piti (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Piti.flf): pretty much a leetspeak font
  - Efti Wall (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Wall.flf): mapping to something else than textual characters
  - Fire Font-s (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fire%20Font-s.flf): differs from "Fire Font-k" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fire%20Font-k.flf) only in the smushing option in the header, however, these options can also be set dynamically. In turn, rename "Fire Font-k" to just "Fire Font"
  - Fun Face (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fun%20Face.flf): seems to be a less complete version (subset of defined characters) of "Fun Faces" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fun%20Faces.flf)
  - Hieroglyphs (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Hieroglyphs.flf): mapping to Egyptian hieroglyphs, not sure if they correspond to printable Unicode characters, also probably a very small subset of hierglpyphs, not useful in practice
  - Larry 3D 2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Larry%203D%202.flf): duplicate of "Larry 3D" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Larry%203D.flf) (exact sime file contents)
  - Old Banner (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Old%20Banner.flf): seems to be an older version of Banner (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Banner.flf) (same author, etc.)
  - Rotated (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Rotated.flf): 90 degrees rotated, ugly, unreadable 2-line font
  - Runic (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Runic.flf): superseded by Runyc (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Runyc.flf) which is an extension adding lower-case runes, and is also part of fgt.figlet.org
  - Note: exclusions, renamings, fixes: 2026-02-29 WENT THROUGH ALL FONTS!
