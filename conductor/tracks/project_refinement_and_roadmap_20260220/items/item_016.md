- The https://patorjk.com/software/taag tool, under the AOL Macro Fonts section in the fonts dropdown, also contains Arial ASCII fonts that are designed to be displayed in Arial instead of a monospace font (see "What are AOL Macro fonts?" on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about). This can be seen as part of Arial ASCII art which is described by patorjk in https://patorjk.com/blog/2025/07/30/new-arial-ascii-art-gallery/, which seems to have been popular in the AOL ecosystem (hence the name). I think these fonts are not included in the font collection we source from the figlet NPM package (they're probably not .flf FIGlet files), and i think we also don't want these fonts, as we want to concentrate on monspace fonts, in order to be displayable in terminals, etc. So, i think we don't need to do anything here, but we can include it in the documentation somewhere for completeness. Somewhere where we describe the ecosystem around ASCII banners.
