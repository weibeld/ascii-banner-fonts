- Clarify font types in patorjk collection:
  - The patorjk collection seems to have 3 types of fonts:
    1. FIGlet fonts: regular FIGlet fonts created for FIGlet by various authors
    2. TOIlet fonts: these are probably actual TOIlet font files (originaly .tlf, now changed to .flf) included in this collection. Since FIGlet is compatible with TOIlet fonts (as stated on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about), this apparently works as is.
    3. ANSI fonts converted to FIGlet: these are apparently old ANSI fonts (originally created with [The Draw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw)) that patorjk manually converted to FIGlet fonts. This is described here https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about and in detail here https://patorjk.com/blog/2014/01/22/thedraws-lost-ansi-art-fonts/. The original ANSI fonts (about 100) can apparently still be found here https://web.archive.org/web/20120819044459/http://www.roysac.com/thedrawfonts-tdf.asp or here http://www.roysac.com/thedrawfonts-tdf.html). patorjk converted only about 14 of these fonts to FIGlet because since ANSI fonts usually make use of colours but there are no colours in FIGlet ASCII fonts, the fonts have to be "stripped down" which is only satisfactorily possible for some of the ANSI fonts.
  - Analyse the fonts in the patorjk/figlet.js repo and try to categorise them into these three types (hints: many TOIlet fonts use some indicators like 'tlf2a' in their header or have some hints about TOIlet in the comments, the ANSI fonts converted by patorijk often mention patorjk in their commentes, it seems that pure FIGlet fonts also may include non-ASCII characters, e.g. "DOS Rebel")
  - TODO: there is somewhere, in the research documents or elsewhere, a section where we analysed the categorisation on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/, at least for TAAG, this should be updated with the above insights
    - The FIGlet font category on TAAG is further divided into "Featured FIGlet Fonts" and "Regular FIGlet Fonts", which, as stated on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about, is based purely on patorjk's opinion of which fonts are the best ones (included in "Featured FIGlet Fonts") and the rest (included in "Regular FIGlet Fonts"). This distinction is not relevant to us and we can look at it as just a single "FIGlet Fonts" category.
