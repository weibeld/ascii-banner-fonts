- Add some error messages displayed when an input character cannot be rendered by the font (because there's no definition for it in the font). This may be different for each font. Include also the count of characters that couldn't be displayed. If, for example, the input string is "Foo123" and the font doesn't have mappings for numbers, then the error message should say that 3 characters couldn't be displayed, and also list these characters ("1", "2", "3").
