- Bug?: why is a font like Spliff (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Spliff.flf) classified as Large, even though its height is even less than e.g. Speed (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Speed.flf)? Is the size categorisation done correctly, i.e. does it erroneously include the "max line length" indicator of the header (this shouldn't be used, but instead the typical width of a character should be used - however, maybe it's also reasonable to drop considering the width altogether and just consider the character height)
