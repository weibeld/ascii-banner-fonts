- Would it make sense to have a single get-fonts.js script with kind of a plugin system, where the logic for each font collection is contained in a separate file (plugin). Adding or removing a font collection then comes down to adding or removing a corresponding plugin file. All the common logic, such as the storage destination and format of the fonts, the command-line output etc would be in the get-fonts.js framework script. The plugin files only include the source-specific necessary bits that cannot be generally implemented in the get-fonts.js script
  - If we have multiple font sources, we should maybe also have a precedence order that defines how to handle duplicate fonts, i.e. if two font collections include the same font (i.e. a font with the same name), which one to include in our registry. This could be an explicit field in the font-versions.json file, or simply the order of the entries in this file (e.g. earlier font collections are loaded earlier, existing fonts take precedence over newly added fonts, i.e. the fonts of a font collection that comes earlier in the file win).
  - Having this type of precedence also requires defining what is seen as "identical" fonts. Maybe for now we can just use the file name as an official font identifier, thus two fonts are considered duplicates if they have the exact same file name. Structural analysis to determine that two fonts are the same is probably more difficult (beyond just diffing the files).
