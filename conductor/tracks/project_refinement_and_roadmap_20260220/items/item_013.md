- ASCII vs ANSI fonts: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ has a dedicated category for ANSI fonts (see other todo item below), these fonts don't only use ASCII characters but also extend to other ANSI characters. The TAAG tool also includes a section with TOIlet fonts which often use non-ASCII characters too. Apparently pure FIGlet fonts may include non-ASCII characters too (e.g. "DOS Rebel"). Maybe we should include something like "ASCII", "Non-ASCII" as additional category (we can do this regardless of the font categorisations on the other tools https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and  https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/)
  - More info about these ANSI fonts here: https://patorjk.com/blog/2014/01/22/thedraws-lost-ansi-art-fonts/
  - The same applies for the fonts grouped under TOIlet fonts which include fonts that make use of non-ASCII characters (e.g. includes fonts that use Braille characters)
