- TBD: consider alternative asset management strategy: all fonts included in the app are maintained in a separate GitHub repository. Updates from upstream sources (e.g. patorjk/figlet.js) is done entirely in this repo. The repo itself can be versioned and then the app itself has just one single versioned dependency (which is in our domain), so in principle, the current asset strategy (including the dependency update workflow) stays valid, except that we have only a single dependency for the assets. The font analysis could then actually also be outsourced and be done entirely in this repo (e.g. on version updates), and the repo could provide a ready-to-use font registry file for the app. The fonts itself must maybe still be locally downloaded by the app at build time because of CORS restrictions (to be checked), however, it would then just be a single download of all fonts from our own sphere of control. The registry data provided by this repo could be really comprehensive, e.g. also including the mappings of ASCII characters to international characters for the international fonts (see other todo items about international fonts).
  - Advantages: 1) makes app simpler (removes logic for font analysis and management of multiple asset sources), 2) storage of fonts in our own sphere of control (no reliance on upstream sources), 3) font repo becomes its own general-purpose resource (largest unified collection of FIGlet fonts on the internet)
  - Note: this invalidates some of the other todo items
