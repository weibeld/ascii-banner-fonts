- Given the analysis of https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts, we could then add xero/figlet-fonts as an additional font collection. The set of fonts to include should be based on the above analysis of https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts, i.e. only include unique fonts that don't already exist in a higher-precedence font collection (such as patorjk/figlet.js). The entire logic for this should be included in the "plugin" import file for the xero/figlet-fonts collection (see the "plugin system" todo item with the single get-fonts.js script)
