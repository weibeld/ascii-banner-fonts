- Font candidates for renaming:
  - All fonts with a prefixed "Small", "Big", or other modifier, that have related fonts (without or with a different modifier): rename them so that the modifier comes after the main name, so that the related fonts are next to each other in the lexical order
  - Big.flf and Small.flf are size versions of Standard.flf, so, consider renaming them to something like "Standard Big.flf", and "Standard Small.flf" so that they are next to each other in the lexical order
  - AMC fonts (all fonts starting with "AMC"): AMC apparently stands for the initials of the creator (Anthony M. Cucchiara) and these fonts all seem to come from the same source (ASCII Editor Service Pack I). We don't need this prefix, either remove it (handle name conflicts with other fonts), or, if necessary, append it in parentheses or something.
  - Add a space between the name and a numeral for all fonts with a numeral (e.g. Banner3)
  - Big Money fonts: make NE, NW, SE, SW upper case
  - "Crawford2" to "Crawford Patorjk" as it is an edit by patorjk on the original Crawford font
  - Cybersmall, Cybermedium, Cyberlarge to "Cyber Small", "Cyber Medium", and "Cyber Large", respectively
  - "Fire Font-k" to "Fire Font"
  - "Georgi16" to "Georgia 16" (this is likely a typo)
  - "NScript" to "NV NScript" to group it with "NV Script" in the lexical order
  - Stampate (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Stampate.flf) to "Stampatello 1": this is the first version of the font now called "Stampatello" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Stampatello.flf). Stampatello adds support for more characters, especially accented characters from the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character set, however, there are also some differences in the common characters between the two fonts, thus it may be justified to keep the first version (Stampate) as "Stampatello 1" and rename the second version to "Stampatello 2"
  - Stampatello to "Stampatello 2"
  - Test1 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Test1.flf) to "Unknown" (we really don't know who is the author)
  - THIS to "THIS!"
  - Note: exclusions, renamings, fixes: 2026-02-29 WENT THROUGH ALL FONTS!
