- TBD: allow editing directly in card for a single font (maybe remaining fonts update asynchronously)? This could update the rendering in real-time typing speed as demonstrated by the other tools (TAAG and Manytools). Currently, when editing in the site-wide input field, there's a lag of close to 1 second until the fonts update (updates ALL fonts on the site). It would be nice if we could have real-time editing, at least for specific fonts.
