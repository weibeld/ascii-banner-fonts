- Add some error messages displayed when an input character cannot be rendered by the font (because there's no definition for it in the font). This may be different for each font.
  - Also requires special handling for international fonts, i.e. fonts that include mappings from ASCII chars to international chars: such a font may have a mapping for "a", but "a" is mapped to an international char, not the letter "a", so this font should display the error message for "a". Exactly which entries are mappings to international chars must be clear anyway for the implementation of the "international char -> ASCII char in font" conversion, so we should have this information. This is static information that is derived from each font at build time.
