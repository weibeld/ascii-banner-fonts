- Investigate TOIlet fonts: the FIGlet program seems to support TOIlet fonts (see e.g. https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about). Should we also include TOIlet fonts that we find? Also, according to the same source, the TOIlet project seems to be not actively developed anymore (see also activity on http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/toilet, if this is the offical homepage of the project). Note: there is already a track for investigating TOIlet fonts support.
