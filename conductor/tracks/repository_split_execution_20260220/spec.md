# Track Specification: Repository Split Execution

## Overview
Perform a comprehensive audit and extraction of all backend-related information from this repository. This track serves as the final "packing phase" before the strategic pivot, ensuring that all research, tracks, and metadata intended for the **Font Data** repository are identified and ready for transfer.

## Goals
1. **Information Audit:** Identify every document, track, and script that logically belongs to the Font Data domain.
2. **Context Preservation:** Ensure that the reasoning and history behind font curation and acquisition are preserved during the extraction.
3. **Clean Handover:** Prepare a definitive list of items to be deleted from this repo and re-initialised in the new one.
4. **Documentation Realignment:** Determine which parts of the root project documentation (README, TODO) need to be extracted.

## Core Activities
- Audit the `conductor/research/` directory for data-focused papers.
- Audit the `conductor/tracks/` directory (both active and archived) for font-related history.
- Audit the `scripts/` directory for font management logic.
- Audit the `conductor/todo.md` for tasks that will transition to the backend backlog.

## Completion Criteria
This track is complete when all backend-related information has been identified, sorted, and recorded in the implementation plan, and the current repository is ready to be stripped of its "Font Data" components.
