- [ ] **Track: Evaluate & Integrate Additional Font Sources**
  *Link: [./tracks/font_sources_20260209/](./tracks/font_sources_20260209/)*
  *Context: [Research Findings](./research/ecosystem.md#community-font-collections)*
  *Description: Integrate the ~87 unique fonts from `xero/figlet-fonts` into our collection. This requires careful de-duplication (as filenames may differ while content is the same) and validation of font integrity.*

- [ ] **Track: Evaluate TOIlet Support**
  *Link: [./tracks/toilet_support_20260209/](./tracks/toilet_support_20260209/)*
  *Context: [Research Findings](./research/ecosystem.md#toilet-the-other-implementation)*
  *Description: Investigate the feasibility of supporting TOIlet (`.tlf`) fonts. This would require updating the rendering engine to support color codes and potentially new file formats.*

- [~] **Track: Project Refinement & Roadmap Planning**
  *Link: [./tracks/project_refinement_and_roadmap_20260220/](./project_refinement_and_roadmap_20260220/)*
  *Description: Systematic grooming of the project brain-dump. Transition from monolithic notes to structured research, implementation tracks, and architectural decisions (including the 'Central Font Repository' strategy).*

- [ ] **Track: Repository Split Execution**
  *Link: [./tracks/repository_split_execution_20260220/](./repository_split_execution_20260220/)*
  *Description: Execute the decoupling of the monolithic repository into specialized Frontend (Application) and Backend (Font Data) projects.*
