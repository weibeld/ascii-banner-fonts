# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
4. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Implement Feature:**
   - Write the code necessary to fulfill the task requirements.
   - Follow the project's code style guidelines.

4. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Refactor the implementation code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance.

5. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

6. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for showcase`.
   - Perform the commit.

7. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 7.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 7.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 7.3: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command to attach the summary to the commit.
     ```bash
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

8. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 8.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the first 7 characters of the *just-completed commit's* commit hash.
    - **Step 8.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

9. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message (e.g., `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Implement copy to clipboard' as complete`).

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    -   **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, and `plan.md` to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    -   You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.

3.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    -   After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    -   **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

4.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Stage all changes.
    -   Perform the commit with a clear and concise message (e.g., `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`).

5.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes:**
    -   **Step 5.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the manual verification steps and the user's confirmation.
    -   **Step 5.2: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command and the full commit hash from the previous step to attach the full report to the checkpoint commit.

6.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
    -   **Step 6.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 6.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the heading for the completed phase, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    -   **Step 6.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

7. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message following the format `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

8.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed verification report attached as a git note.

## Track Completion & Archiving

Once all tasks in a track's implementation plan are marked as complete and the project documentation has been synchronised, the track must be archived to maintain a clean workspace.

1.  **Archiving Command:** Use the provided automation to archive the track:
    ```bash
    ./conductor/scripts/archive_track.sh <track_id>
    ```
2.  **What it Does:**
    -   Moves the track folder from `conductor/tracks/` to `conductor/archive/` using `git mv` to preserve file history.
    -   Automatically removes the track's entry from the active registry in `conductor/tracks.md`.
    -   Stages the changes for commit.
3.  **Final Commitment:** After running the archive command, commit the changes with a message like `chore(conductor): Archive track '<track_description>'`.

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors
- [ ] Works correctly in browser
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All code implemented to specification
2. Code passes all configured linting and static analysis checks
3. Implementation notes added to `plan.md`
4. Changes committed with proper message
5. Git note with task summary attached to the commit
