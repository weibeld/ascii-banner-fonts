# Initial Concept
The goal of this project is a web app (as static as possible) that showcases a large number of Figlet ASCII art banner fonts at once (i.e. you can enter an example text and it displays it in ALL the available fonts and you can browse through them)

# Product Definition - ASCII Banners

## Vision
A high-performance, static web application designed to showcase and browse a vast collection of FIGlet ASCII art fonts. Users can enter text once and see it instantly rendered across hundreds of different styles, enabling rapid comparison and selection of the perfect ASCII banner.

## Core Features
- **Live Bulk Rendering:** Real-time rendering of user input across the entire font library.
- **Dynamic Search & Filtering:** Quick search to find specific fonts by name or style.
- **Favorites & Collections:** Ability for users to "star" or save fonts into a local collection for quick access.
- **One-Click Export:** "Copy to Clipboard" functionality for the generated ASCII art to facilitate use in other applications.
- **Static First Architecture:** Optimized for fast loading and offline-capable usage without a complex backend.

## Research Goals
A dedicated research phase is required to answer key questions regarding the origin of FIGlet, the nature of the font set (specifically the `patorjk` collection), and the relationship with other ASCII art tools like TOIlet.
