- UI tweaks:
  - Add copy-to-clipboard button to each rendering
  - Add link back to font definition file for each font
  - Add quick switch for switching between dark and light mode
  - Add controls to change text colour (and maybe backround colour)
  - Add shorthand option for inserting default text in input field (e.g. "ABCDEFGH...123..." or something similar)
  - Option for displaying fine helper lines in cars (baseline, descender line, ascender line, etc., might also include a full grid showing all the cells)
  - Display number of supported characters of each font
  - Size selection UI could be a slider (or double slider) to freely select a range of sizes. The size would then be defined as the character height (could be with or without descenders)
- TBD: in cards in UI, can ascender and descender lines be only displayed if there is currently actually a character using them (https://patorjk.com/software/taag seems to to it)?
- Extract number of supported characters as metadata in font analysis
- TBD: allow editing directly in card for a single font (maybe remaining fonts update asynchronously)? This could update the rendering in real-time typing speed as demonstrated by the other tools (TAAG and Manytools). Currently, when editing in the site-wide input field, there's a lag of close to 1 second until the fonts update (updates ALL fonts on the site). It would be nice if we could have real-time editing, at least for specific fonts.
- Favourite system: allow marking fonts as favourite and later separately view them, either at the top of the page, in a sidebar, etc.
  - No persistent session storage needed (i.e. no user login), maybe storage in cookie (or just URL) for short-term memory
  - Include button for clearing favourites
- Evaluate additional FIGlet font sources on https://www.figlet.org/ (list of links below "Many fonts are also available:")
  - ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/fonts/: (URL from https://www.figlet.org/faq.html and https://www.figlet.org/) unsecured access actually works with FileZilla or macOS Finder, fonts are available, find a way to programmatically download and analyse collections, especially overlap with patorjk font collection. Incorporate task into [font_sources_20260209] track
  - TBD: these collections also include international fonts (ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/fonts/international.tar.gz) which map ASCII characters to characters of international alphabets. Should we also include these fonts and add an additional category?
    - Actually the international fonts in this package are included in the patorjk collection (except the CJK font pacakge below)
    - For the international fonts, consider a feature where you can input the desired text in the target alphabet and the conversion to the corresponding ASCII characters (to be compatible with the FIGlet font format) happens automatically (requires the feature to know the mappings, which probably need to be extracted manually from the comment sections of the international font files).
      - Could this be done through the same input field? I.e. input in any character set, and then only the fonts that can print the entered characters are displayed. E.g. you can enter カタカナ and then only the Japanese fonts that can print this are displayed, without the need to select any special settings in the UI
      - In that case, what to do if a user enters the ASCII characters that are mapped to the international characters (we can assume that in this case the user actually wants o print the ASCII characters since support for international characters is implemented by entering the international characters directly)? In that case, since these specific ASCII characters cannot be printed by the font (since they're mapped to international characters) simply omit printing them.
    - Mind-blowing: the international font collection also includes a CJK package for FIGlet 2.2 which includes fonts for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean that contain thousands of kanji. Check if this can be used in any way (i.e. what input characters are mapped to the kanji?)
- Add some error messages displayed when an input character cannot be rendered by the font (because there's no definition for it in the font). This may be different for each font.
  - Also requires special handling for international fonts, i.e. fonts that include mappings from ASCII chars to international chars: such a font may have a mapping for "a", but "a" is mapped to an international char, not the letter "a", so this font should display the error message for "a". Exactly which entries are mappings to international chars must be clear anyway for the implementation of the "international char -> ASCII char in font" conversion, so we should have this information. This is static information that is derived from each font at build time.
- Would it make sense to have a single get-fonts.js script with kind of a plugin system, where the logic for each font collection is contained in a separate file (plugin). Adding or removing a font collection then comes down to adding or removing a corresponding plugin file. All the common logic, such as the storage destination and format of the fonts, the command-line output etc would be in the get-fonts.js framework script. The plugin files only include the source-specific necessary bits that cannot be generally implemented in the get-fonts.js script
  - If we have multiple font sources, we should maybe also have a precedence order that defines how to handle duplicate fonts, i.e. if two font collections include the same font (i.e. a font with the same name), which one to include in our registry. This could be an explicit field in the font-versions.json file, or simply the order of the entries in this file (e.g. earlier font collections are loaded earlier, existing fonts take precedence over newly added fonts, i.e. the fonts of a font collection that comes earlier in the file win).
  - Having this type of precedence also requires defining what is seen as "identical" fonts. Maybe for now we can just use the file name as an official font identifier, thus two fonts are considered duplicates if they have the exact same file name. Structural analysis to determine that two fonts are the same is probably more difficult (beyond just diffing the files).
- Analysing https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts fonts
  1. Repo structure:
     - There are some .flc files, what are they? Are they required for anything?
     - There are also som .tlf files. I guess they are Toilet fonts, should we ignore them?
  2. Duplicates within the repo: it seems that there are duplicate versions of supposedly the same font where one file name is in lower case and the other file name is in in title case with spaces, etc. I saw that some of these corresponding file contents are identical, others differ slightly or have notes in the comments saying that one version fixes some bugs in another version, etc. I think we should get a clear overview of this situation, i.e. clone the repo and analyse all the fonts one by one, find lower-case/title-case pairs, and answer questions like:
    - What are the title-case file name fonts and what are the lower-case file name fonts? Does always one preceed the other (e.g. lower-case being an iteration of title-case, title-case being the original version, etc)? Is one supposed to be the final publishable version? Also consider looking at the Git history to answer these questions.
    - Do all title-case fonts have a corresponding lower-case version and vice versa? Are there title-case fonts with no lower-case font, or are there lower-case fonts with no title-case fonts?
    - What are the differences of corresponding lower-case/title-case font versions (if any)? Is it just bug fixes or formatting? Or are there significant changes? Also look at the comment sections of the font files
    - As a result of this, we should be able to create a final canonical list of unique fonts that we can get out of this repository
  3. Overlap with https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js
    - Calculate what fonts of xero/figlet-fonts already exist in patorjk/figlet.js, what fonts do only exist in xero/figlet-fonts, and what fonts do only exist in patorjk/figlet.js
    - We consider patorjk/figlet.js the more authoritative source since it is more active, so the goal would only be to take the fonts from xero/figlet-fonts that don't exist in patorjk/figlet.js. We would always give preference to the fonts in patorjk/figlet.js
- Given the analysis of https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts, we could then add xero/figlet-fonts as an additional font collection. The set of fonts to include should be based on the above analysis of https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts, i.e. only include unique fonts that don't already exist in a higher-precedence font collection (such as patorjk/figlet.js). The entire logic for this should be included in the "plugin" import file for the xero/figlet-fonts collection (see the "plugin system" todo item with the single get-fonts.js script)
- For the dependency update workflow, check if Renovate (https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) could be used or if it's overkill
- Investigate TOIlet fonts: the FIGlet program seems to support TOIlet fonts (see e.g. https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about). Should we also include TOIlet fonts that we find? Also, according to the same source, the TOIlet project seems to be not actively developed anymore (see also activity on http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/toilet, if this is the offical homepage of the project). Note: there is already a track for investigating TOIlet fonts support.
- ASCII vs ANSI fonts: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ has a dedicated category for ANSI fonts (see other todo item below), these fonts don't only use ASCII characters but also extend to other ANSI characters. The TAAG tool also includes a section with TOIlet fonts which often use non-ASCII characters too. Apparently pure FIGlet fonts may include non-ASCII characters too (e.g. "DOS Rebel"). Maybe we should include something like "ASCII", "Non-ASCII" as additional category (we can do this regardless of the font categorisations on the other tools https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and  https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/)
  - More info about these ANSI fonts here: https://patorjk.com/blog/2014/01/22/thedraws-lost-ansi-art-fonts/
  - The same applies for the fonts grouped under TOIlet fonts which include fonts that make use of non-ASCII characters (e.g. includes fonts that use Braille characters)
- Revisit categorisation by other tools https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/ and https://patorjk.com/software/taag/:
  - We have written in a research doc or elsewhere that the categorisations used by these tools is not meaningful, however, this should be updated based on the analysis elsewhere in this todo list
    - The categorisation on Manytools largely follows the categorisation on TAAG (including distinction of "Selected FIGlet Fonts" and "Other FIGlet Fonts", which is not relevant to us), however some details vary, for example, there is no "TOIlet Fonts" category and there are fewer fonts in the "ASCII-extended fonts"/"ANSI FIGlet Fonts" section. Manytools is probably based on an older version of https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js, (btw, it explicitly states that it is based on https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js)
- Check out what is https://artcode.org/ascii/index.php (ASCII Arts Web Ring) and evaluate if it's worth registering the app there
- The https://patorjk.com/software/taag tool, under the AOL Macro Fonts section in the fonts dropdown, also contains Arial ASCII fonts that are designed to be displayed in Arial instead of a monospace font (see "What are AOL Macro fonts?" on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about). This can be seen as part of Arial ASCII art which is described by patorjk in https://patorjk.com/blog/2025/07/30/new-arial-ascii-art-gallery/, which seems to have been popular in the AOL ecosystem (hence the name). I think these fonts are not included in the font collection we source from the figlet NPM package (they're probably not .flf FIGlet files), and i think we also don't want these fonts, as we want to concentrate on monspace fonts, in order to be displayable in terminals, etc. So, i think we don't need to do anything here, but we can include it in the documentation somewhere for completeness. Somewhere where we describe the ecosystem around ASCII banners.
- BUG: about 23 fonts in the current font registry have Unknown for both 'size' and 'casing'. This includes all the TOIlet fonts. Investigate reason
- Clarify font types in patorjk collection:
  - The patorjk collection seems to have 3 types of fonts:
    1. FIGlet fonts: regular FIGlet fonts created for FIGlet by various authors
    2. TOIlet fonts: these are probably actual TOIlet font files (originaly .tlf, now changed to .flf) included in this collection. Since FIGlet is compatible with TOIlet fonts (as stated on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about), this apparently works as is.
    3. ANSI fonts converted to FIGlet: these are apparently old ANSI fonts (originally created with [The Draw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw)) that patorjk manually converted to FIGlet fonts. This is described here https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about and in detail here https://patorjk.com/blog/2014/01/22/thedraws-lost-ansi-art-fonts/. The original ANSI fonts (about 100) can apparently still be found here https://web.archive.org/web/20120819044459/http://www.roysac.com/thedrawfonts-tdf.asp or here http://www.roysac.com/thedrawfonts-tdf.html). patorjk converted only about 14 of these fonts to FIGlet because since ANSI fonts usually make use of colours but there are no colours in FIGlet ASCII fonts, the fonts have to be "stripped down" which is only satisfactorily possible for some of the ANSI fonts.
  - Analyse the fonts in the patorjk/figlet.js repo and try to categorise them into these three types (hints: many TOIlet fonts use some indicators like 'tlf2a' in their header or have some hints about TOIlet in the comments, the ANSI fonts converted by patorijk often mention patorjk in their commentes, it seems that pure FIGlet fonts also may include non-ASCII characters, e.g. "DOS Rebel")
  - TODO: there is somewhere, in the research documents or elsewhere, a section where we analysed the categorisation on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/ and https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/, at least for TAAG, this should be updated with the above insights
    - The FIGlet font category on TAAG is further divided into "Featured FIGlet Fonts" and "Regular FIGlet Fonts", which, as stated on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=about, is based purely on patorjk's opinion of which fonts are the best ones (included in "Featured FIGlet Fonts") and the rest (included in "Regular FIGlet Fonts"). This distinction is not relevant to us and we can look at it as just a single "FIGlet Fonts" category.
- TBD: evaluate whether to include code comment option in UI, i.e. formatting the banner with prefixed comment characters for various languages so that it can be copy-pasted into source files (as implemented e.g. on https://patorjk.com/software/taag/)
- TBD: evaluate optional display of header comments of font files in UI (as implemented on https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/ as "Display info about selected font")
- .flf font file magic first line format for the records (research), as stated in the header comments of some font files:
  ```
  Explanation of first line:
  flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
  a    - should always be `a', for now
  $    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
  7    - height of a character
  6    - height of a character, not including descenders
  100  -  max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
  15   - default smushmode for this font
  31   - number of comment lines
  1    - print right-to-left (figlet 2.1 or later only)
  ```
- TBD: consider alternative asset management strategy: all fonts included in the app are maintained in a separate GitHub repository. Updates from upstream sources (e.g. patorjk/figlet.js) is done entirely in this repo. The repo itself can be versioned and then the app itself has just one single versioned dependency (which is in our domain), so in principle, the current asset strategy (including the dependency update workflow) stays valid, except that we have only a single dependency for the assets. The font analysis could then actually also be outsourced and be done entirely in this repo (e.g. on version updates), and the repo could provide a ready-to-use font registry file for the app. The fonts itself must maybe still be locally downloaded by the app at build time because of CORS restrictions (to be checked), however, it would then just be a single download of all fonts from our own sphere of control. The registry data provided by this repo could be really comprehensive, e.g. also including the mappings of ASCII characters to international characters for the international fonts (see other todo items about international fonts).
  - Advantages: 1) makes app simpler (removes logic for font analysis and management of multiple asset sources), 2) storage of fonts in our own sphere of control (no reliance on upstream sources), 3) font repo becomes its own general-purpose resource (largest unified collection of FIGlet fonts on the internet)
  - Note: this invalidates some of the other todo items
- Make TOIlet fonts as a separate category
- For the records: there are single-case fonts that are only lower-case, for example [Mike](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Mike.flf), [Whimsy](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Whimsy.flf)
- Font candidates for exclusion (fonts that are part of a collection we use but that we may omit in our own registry):
  - Mnemonic (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Mnemonic.flf): this is not really a display font, but a mapping of special non-ASCII characters to an obsolete standard of mnemonics encoded as a FIGlet font. For example, inputting "Æ" simply prints "&AE". These mnemonics were defined in [RFC 1345](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1345) in 1992. This font is part of the patorjk collection, but it seems not be part of the ftp.figlet.org set
  - ICL-1900 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/ICL-1900.flf): this font prints characters in the ICL-1900 punch card format, which is also not really useful (looks like something is broken). Also not part of the ftp.figlet.org collection.
  - Octal (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Octal.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their octal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Hex (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Hex.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their hexadecimal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Binary (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Binary.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their binary ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Decimal (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Decimal.flf): simply a mapping of ASCII characters to their decimal ASCII codes, not a display font. Part of the ftp.figlet.org collection (contributions/)
  - Morse (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Morse.flf): mapping of ASCII characters to Morse code, not a display font, not in ftp.figlet.org collection
  - Morse2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Morse2.flf): idem Morse
  - Nancyj-Improved (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Nancyj-Improved.flf): seems to be identical to Nancyj (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Nancyj.flf) with the only difference that Nancyj-Improved uses Windows line endings while Nancyj uses Unix line endings. The ftp.figlet.org collection only contains Nancyj but not Nancyj-Improved
  - Rot13 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Rot13.flf): not a display font, simply rotates alphabetical characters by 13 positions, also included in the ftp.figlet.org collection
  - Upside Down Text (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Upside%20Down%20Text.flf): a mapping of characters to upside down lookalike characters, not really a banner display font, created by patorjk
  - WideTerm (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/WideTerm.flf): this is mapping of characters to their CJK full-width equivalents, i.e. the latin full-width characters in the CJK input methods, not really a display font, from the TOIlet fonts
  - WoW (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Wow.flf): single row leetspeak font that is very unreadable, coming from the World of Warcraft world from 2005, pretty outdated
  - 1Row (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/1Row.flf): single row leetspeak font very unreadable, very similar to WoW
  - B1FF (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/B1FF.flf): another leetspeak font
  - Benjamin (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Benjamin.flf): another leetspeak font
  - AMC 3 LIV (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/AMC%203%20Liv1.flf): 3-line high, 90 degrees rotated, very unreadable font (reminds of leetspeak)
  - Circle (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Circle.flf): mapping of characters to circled characters (like e.g. Ⓐ), not a display font, TOIlet font, part of the official TOIlet font distribution
  - Crawford (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Crawford.flf): this font has been improved by patorjk as Crawford2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Crawford2.flf) which is much better. Exclude Crawford and instead rename Crawford2 to "Crawford Patorjk"
  - DWhistled (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/DWhistled.flf): not a display font, according to its own comment a mapping for prodcuing "fingering charts, called tablature, for six hole diatonic flutes such as the tin whistle"
  - Efti Chess (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Chess.flf): mapping to something else than textual characters
  - Efti Piti (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Piti.flf): pretty much a leetspeak font
  - Efti Wall (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Efti%20Wall.flf): mapping to something else than textual characters
  - Fire Font-s (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fire%20Font-s.flf): differs from "Fire Font-k" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fire%20Font-k.flf) only in the smushing option in the header, however, these options can also be set dynamically. In turn, rename "Fire Font-k" to just "Fire Font"
  - Fun Face (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fun%20Face.flf): seems to be a less complete version (subset of defined characters) of "Fun Faces" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Fun%20Faces.flf)
  - Hieroglyphs (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Hieroglyphs.flf): mapping to Egyptian hieroglyphs, not sure if they correspond to printable Unicode characters, also probably a very small subset of hierglpyphs, not useful in practice
  - Larry 3D 2 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Larry%203D%202.flf): duplicate of "Larry 3D" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Larry%203D.flf) (exact sime file contents)
  - Old Banner (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Old%20Banner.flf): seems to be an older version of Banner (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Banner.flf) (same author, etc.)
  - Rotated (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Rotated.flf): 90 degrees rotated, ugly, unreadable 2-line font
  - Runic (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Runic.flf): superseded by Runyc (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Runyc.flf) which is an extension adding lower-case runes, and is also part of fgt.figlet.org
  - Note: exclusions, renamings, fixes: 2026-02-29 WENT THROUGH ALL FONTS!
- Font candidates for improving/fixing:
  - Wavescape (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Wavescape.flf): has large empty space below each character (8-10 lines), the capital A looks different from other characters, height of some other capital characters and digits varies --> or exclude it, this font seems unfinished and is fucking ugly!!
  - DiamFont (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/DiamFont.flf): shouldn't the lower-case "g" be lifted by 2 lines (only character that has a lower baseline)?
  - Note: exclusions, renamings, fixes: 2026-02-29 WENT THROUGH ALL FONTS!
- UI glitches:
  - Currently when changing the input and the height of the display card changes (probably inevitable), the scroll position jumps to a new place (i.e. you don't see the same card at the same position on the screen anymore), which is very distracting. The screen should be fixed at a specific logical position (e.g. in the middle of the screen) even when editing the input text)
  - When the input field is empty, cards have different heights (probably based on the height specifciation in the font files). All cards should have the same height if they are empty.
- TBD: normalise all fonts to have no empty lines at top and bottom and no empty column at the left (if not already the case, must check all characters)?
- TBD: font files seem to be a mix of Windows line endings and Unix line endings. Normalise everything to Unix line endings in the assets creation stage?
- Font candidates for renaming:
  - All fonts with a prefixed "Small", "Big", or other modifier, that have related fonts (without or with a different modifier): rename them so that the modifier comes after the main name, so that the related fonts are next to each other in the lexical order
  - Big.flf and Small.flf are size versions of Standard.flf, so, consider renaming them to something like "Standard Big.flf", and "Standard Small.flf" so that they are next to each other in the lexical order
  - AMC fonts (all fonts starting with "AMC"): AMC apparently stands for the initials of the creator (Anthony M. Cucchiara) and these fonts all seem to come from the same source (ASCII Editor Service Pack I). We don't need this prefix, either remove it (handle name conflicts with other fonts), or, if necessary, append it in parentheses or something.
  - Add a space between the name and a numeral for all fonts with a numeral (e.g. Banner3)
  - Big Money fonts: make NE, NW, SE, SW upper case
  - "Crawford2" to "Crawford Patorjk" as it is an edit by patorjk on the original Crawford font
  - Cybersmall, Cybermedium, Cyberlarge to "Cyber Small", "Cyber Medium", and "Cyber Large", respectively
  - "Fire Font-k" to "Fire Font"
  - "Georgi16" to "Georgia 16" (this is likely a typo)
  - "NScript" to "NV NScript" to group it with "NV Script" in the lexical order
  - Stampate (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Stampate.flf) to "Stampatello 1": this is the first version of the font now called "Stampatello" (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Stampatello.flf). Stampatello adds support for more characters, especially accented characters from the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character set, however, there are also some differences in the common characters between the two fonts, thus it may be justified to keep the first version (Stampate) as "Stampatello 1" and rename the second version to "Stampatello 2"
  - Stampatello to "Stampatello 2"
  - Test1 (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Test1.flf) to "Unknown" (we really don't know who is the author)
  - THIS to "THIS!"
  - Note: exclusions, renamings, fixes: 2026-02-29 WENT THROUGH ALL FONTS!
- Bug?: why is a font like Spliff (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Spliff.flf) classified as Large, even though its height is even less than e.g. Speed (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/blob/main/fonts/Speed.flf)? Is the size categorisation done correctly, i.e. does it erroneously include the "max line length" indicator of the header (this shouldn't be used, but instead the typical width of a character should be used - however, maybe it's also reasonable to drop considering the width altogether and just consider the character height)
- For the records: when investigating the effects of smushing etc, look at a font like "Diet Cola" which contains horizontally overlapping characters
