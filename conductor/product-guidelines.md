# Product Guidelines - ASCII Banners

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist-Modern. The interface should be lean and high-contrast, ensuring that the ASCII art remains the focal point.
- **Color Palette:** Deep charcoal/black backgrounds with vibrant, neon accents (e.g., lime green or amber) to highlight the rendered text.
- **Typography:** Monospace fonts for ASCII previews to ensure alignment, paired with clean, sans-serif fonts for UI controls (like 'Segoe UI' or 'Inter').
- **Spacing:** Generous margins and padding around "font cards" to prevent visual clutter and maintain focus.

## Prose & Messaging
- **Tone:** Professional and functional. Instructions and status messages should be direct and concise.
- **Terminology:** Use standard FIGlet terminology (e.g., "Fonts", "Rendering", "FLF") to provide clarity for technical users while remaining accessible.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Zero Friction:** Inputs should have immediate visual feedback. Re-rendering of hundreds of fonts must be optimized (e.g., debouncing) to maintain responsiveness.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast for all UI elements and provide clear labels for search and controls.
